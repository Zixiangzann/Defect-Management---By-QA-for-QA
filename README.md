# Defect-Management---By-QA-for-QA

Still buidling in progress....
A Defect Management system created by QA for QA.

Motivation
As a QA I always wanted to create my own defect management system. 

To Do

- User Management
Admin access only
(Admin to create/remove members/user account) 
(Admin to assign project to members)

- Defect Tracking system
- (Create,edit,delete defects)
- Only members that are assigned to the project will be able to see the defects. Admin will be able to see all projects.
- Create defects with details such as
Title,Description,Project,Components,Assignee,Server,Issue Type,Severity,Status
- Search and filter defects

- Generate and export Report. To excel,json and charts

- Project Management
Admin access only.
Add new project.
Add components/assignee to project.
